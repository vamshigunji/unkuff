# 📋 PM Briefing: Epic 7 Priority Override

**Date:** 2026-01-25  
**From:** Winston (Architect)  
**To:** Product Manager  
**RE:** Immediate Prioritization of Story 7.1 for Dev Engineer

---

## Executive Summary

The Architect has completed the design work for **Epic 7: Data Orchestration & Smart Ingestion Architecture**. This epic addresses critical questions around how job data flows through the system:

- When does Apify get triggered?
- How do we handle multiple users with the same search criteria?
- How does data refresh work over time?

**Immediate Action Required:** Story 7.1 must be prioritized as the **next work item** for the Dev Engineer.

---

## 🚨 Priority Override: Story 7.1

### What Is It?

A **manual trigger button** in the development environment that allows developers to initiate Apify job pulls on-demand, with full real-time feedback.

### Why P0-CRITICAL?

| Reason | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Cost Control** | Apify charges per API call. Uncontrolled testing wastes credits ($$$) |
| **Testing Bottleneck** | Without this, devs can't efficiently test the ingestion pipeline |
| **Prerequisite** | Stories 7.2-7.5 depend on having a reliable way to trigger and verify ingestion |
| **Low Risk** | Dev-only feature, auto-excluded from production builds |

### Estimation

- **Complexity:** Low-Medium
- **Time:** 2-4 hours
- **Dependencies:** None (all prerequisites from Epic 2 are complete)

## Epic 7 Story Sequence

| Order | Story | Priority | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **7.1: Dev Test Button** | **P0-CRITICAL** | ready-for-dev | 🚨 NEXT WORK ITEM |
| 2 | 7.3: Criteria Management | P2 | backlog | UI for search preferences |
| 3 | 7.2: Shared Job Pool | P2 | backlog | Schema refactor (breaking) |
| 4 | 7.4: Criteria Deduplication | P3 | backlog | Optimization |
| 5 | 7.5: Cron Job | P3 | backlog | ⚠️ PRODUCTION ONLY |

## Current Sprint Status

### Completed
- ✅ Epic 1: Sovereign Identity & Truth Anchor Vault
- ✅ Epic 2: Robust Hybrid Ingestion Engine
- ✅ Epic 3: Pro-Grade Command Center UI
- ✅ Epic 4: High-Density Workspace & Template Library
- ✅ Epic 5: Semantic Matcher & Gap Analysis

### In Progress
- 🔄 Epic 6: Automated ATS Tailoring & Export Pilot
  - 6.1: ✅ Done
  - 6.2: 🔍 Review
  - 6.3: 📋 Backlog

- 🔄 **Epic 7: Data Orchestration (NEW)**
  - 7.1: 🚨 **READY-FOR-DEV (NEXT)**
  - 7.2-7.5: 📋 Backlog

---

## Decision Required

**Question for PM:** Should the Dev Engineer:

1. **Complete 6.2 review first**, then start 7.1?  
2. **Start 7.1 immediately** while 6.2 is in review?

**Architect Recommendation:** Option 2 — 7.1 is orthogonal to Epic 6 and provides immediate testing value.

## Story Files Created

All stories are documented in `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`:

```
7-1-dev-test-apify-trigger-button.md   ← DETAILED SPEC AVAILABLE
7-2-shared-job-pool-architecture.md
7-3-job-criteria-management.md
7-4-criteria-deduplication-engine.md
7-5-scheduled-background-ingestion-cron.md
```

---

## Technical Spec Available

A comprehensive technical specification for Story 7.1 has been created for the Dev Engineer at:

```
_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/7-1-dev-test-apify-trigger-button-tech-spec.md
```

This includes:
- Exact file structure
- Component hierarchy
- Server action signatures
- Environment guards
- UI mockup description
- Definition of Done checklist

---

## Next Steps

1. **PM:** Acknowledge this priority override
2. **PM:** Assign Story 7.1 to Dev Engineer
3. **Dev Engineer:** Read tech spec and begin implementation
4. **Architect:** Available for questions via `[CH]` chat mode
